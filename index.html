          Hi, welcome to the my websiteJames Harder. The goal of this site is to help you develop your online presence. To that end I've divided this site into three sections. Information to help you, information about how I can help you, and a section Containing some of the toy projects I'm working on,which will give you some information about who I am.

          I'd like to talk a little about what I believe here. For the first two third of my life I lived a pretty self menu life. But after being Introduced to a school of thought called distributism I've changed how I see the world. Although distributists can be a fairly anachronistic people individually, the four principles that underlie distributism are very much in line with with some contemporary progressive ideals.
