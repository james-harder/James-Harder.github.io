        <h3>This Site</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, welcome! This is my fledgling home on the internet. Here you can find some information about me, what I'm doing, and what I can do to help you.
        </p>
        <h3>The Author (me)</h3>
        <p>
          My name is James Harder. In 2001 I joined the family business, a machine shop started by my father. Together we grew the business, and in 2007 we became a part of Rotek Services, Inc. Since then I have gotten married, had two children, continued to learn about being a machinist (and welder, and fabricator, and mechanic...) I have also had the chance to train in supervision at Wichita State's <a href="http://www.cmd.wichita.edu/">CMD</a>. In the fiteen years since I began working in this field I have continued to grow. As a machinist, and as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is time for me to grow in a different direction. In 2012 I began studying at Wichita State's College of Engineering. At WSU I have been introduced to the many ways that the digital world is changing the way we live, and work. Even fields such as manufacturing, industrial service, and maintenence have begun to embrace the internet of things. The more I studied the digital and computational side of work, the more I realized that I had some unfilfilled potential that was more suited to the digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now I am trying to transition into a new career. A career as a developer, where my desire to create can be supplemented by my love for new technologies.
        </p>
